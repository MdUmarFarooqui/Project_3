Real Estate Pricing Analysis
Overview
This project aims to analyze how customer preferences and amenities impact house prices using a real estate pricing dataset. The analysis includes data loading, cleaning, univariate and multivariate analysis, feature engineering, and exploration of market trends and customer preferences.

Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these libraries using pip:

# Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame
df = pd.read_csv('real_estate_data.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(df.head())
Data Cleaning
Clean the dataset by handling missing values, removing duplicates, and addressing anomalies.

# Check for missing values
missing_values = df.isnull().sum()
print("Missing Values:\n", missing_values)

# Handle missing values
df = df.dropna()

# Remove duplicate entries
df = df.drop_duplicates()

# Display summary statistics
print(df.describe())
Univariate Analysis
Explore individual variables to understand their distributions and characteristics.

# Plot the distribution of house prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(df['SalePrice'], kde=True)
plt.title('Distribution of House Prices')
plt.xlabel('House Price')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()
Multivariate Analysis
Investigate relationships between multiple variables, especially those impacting house prices.

# Correlation heatmap to see how amenities correlate with house prices
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
correlation_matrix = df.corr()
sns.heatmap(correlation_matrix, annot=True, cmap='coolwarm')
plt.title('Correlation Matrix')
plt.show()
Feature Engineering
Create new features that capture relevant information for pricing analysis.

# Create new feature: Price per Square Foot
df['PricePerSqFt'] = df['SalePrice'] / df['GrLivArea']

# Create new feature: Age of the house
df['HouseAge'] = df['YrSold'] - df['YearBuilt']

# Display the first few rows of the modified DataFrame
print(df.head())
Feature Engineering and Size Impact
Further analyze the impact of features and size on house prices.

python
Copy code
# Scatter plot to see the relationship between GrLivArea and SalePrice
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='GrLivArea', y='SalePrice', data=df)
plt.title('House Price vs. Above Ground Living Area')
plt.xlabel('Above Ground Living Area (sq ft)')
plt.ylabel('House Price')
plt.show()

# Box plot to see how the number of bedrooms impacts house prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='BedroomAbvGr', y='SalePrice', data=df)
plt.title('House Price vs. Number of Bedrooms')
plt.xlabel('Number of Bedrooms')
plt.ylabel('House Price')
plt.show()
Market Trends and Historical Pricing
Explore historical pricing trends over time and understand market influences.

# Line plot to see house prices over different years
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.lineplot(x='YrSold', y='SalePrice', data=df)
plt.title('House Prices Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Year Sold')
plt.ylabel('House Price')
plt.show()
Customer Preferences and Amenities
Investigate how customer preferences and amenities impact house prices.

# Box plot to see how the presence of a swimming pool impacts house prices
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.boxplot(x='PoolArea', y='SalePrice', data=df)
plt.title('House Price vs. Pool Area')
plt.xlabel('Pool Area (sq ft)')
plt.ylabel('House Price')
plt.show()

# Bar plot to see the average house price by overall quality
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='OverallQual', y='SalePrice', data=df, estimator=sum)
plt.title('Average House Price by Overall Quality')
plt.xlabel('Overall Quality')
plt.ylabel('Average House Price')
plt.show()

# Insights and Recommendations

## Key Insights
High-Quality Construction: Investing in higher construction quality (Overall Quality) significantly impacts house prices.
Living Area: Larger living areas, both above ground and total square footage, are key drivers of house prices.
Amenities: Including desirable amenities like swimming pools and garages can substantially increase property values.
Market Trends: Regularly monitor market trends to understand pricing dynamics and adjust strategies accordingly.

## Recommendations
Focus on high-quality construction to increase property value.
Consider adding amenities like swimming pools and garages to attract buyers.
Monitor market trends for better pricing strategies.

# Challenges and Solutions

## Challenges
Missing Data: Managed by dropping rows with missing values. Future work could explore imputation methods to retain more data.
Outliers: Outliers in house prices were identified, and their impact was considered during analysis. Robust statistical methods can help mitigate their influence.

## Solutions
Implement imputation techniques to handle missing data.
Use robust statistical methods to handle outliers.

## Conclusion
This analysis provides valuable insights into the factors affecting house prices. By focusing on high-impact features and understanding market trends, real estate professionals can make more informed decisions. Future work could include predictive modeling to forecast house prices based on these features.
